## Outbound deliverability (DKIM/SPF/DMARC audit, 2026-07-22)

Audit of `DeliverSmtpOutboundJob` → `OutboundDeliverer`:

- **SPF: DNS-only, nothing enforces it** — code only exposes
  `SMTP_HELO_HOST`; nothing verifies the published SPF record
  includes the sending IP. Covered by the "Domain-setup DNS checker"
  item below. Note: via `MAIL_ON_RAILS_SMARTHOST`, SPF is evaluated
  against the smarthost's IP, so its SPF posture is what matters.
- **DMARC: passes when the above hold** — needs aligned DKIM *or*
  aligned SPF; with a key present and envelope-from == header-from,
  outbound passes. No code needed beyond the alignment fix above.
- **Not covered by code (operator checklist)** — PTR/FCrDNS for the
  sending IP; also note outbound STARTTLS uses `tls_verify: false`
  (fine for deliverability, worth knowing).
